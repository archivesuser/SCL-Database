(Excerpts from the Community Gang Truce Document)

We aetively support the Gang Truce initiated by the Crips and the Bloods of Watts, California.
We understand that the Truce is not just a cessation of gang warfare, but a dynamic, militant
movement for social justice. We are very proud of the young women and men who have risked

0 The campaign for a full refunding of cutbacks in local schools, welfare, and recreation
budgets.

0 Resistance against the mass crirninalization of youth of color, especially the use of non—

0 Freedom for all political prisoners, including DeWayne Holmes, Geronimo Pratt, and
Leonard Peltier.
