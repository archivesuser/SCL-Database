Act Up had already made possible a politics (liieczmi against shame and normalization. and aiming at a complex

mobilization ofpeople beyond sexual identity, It in turn gate rise to other groups, including Queer Nation—whose

The emblematic example ofthat kind of street politics, for me, was an anonymous, photocopied broadside that was
handed around during the 1992 primary season. (Its author, the artisr Zoe Leonard, was a member ofFierce Pussy, a
lesbian feminist group with roots in Act Up.) It began with a simple declaration that looked like a familiar kind of

lesbian politics: "I want a dyke for president.” (In queer studies, that would now be called "homonationalism.") But

been in love and been hurt, who respects sex, who has made mistakes and learned from them. I want a Black
woman for president. I want someone with bad teeth and an atﬁmde, someone who has eaten that nasty hospital
