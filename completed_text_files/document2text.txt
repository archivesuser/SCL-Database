answers from part (a) show how A impacts the competitive equilibrium. I want you to z'rzttrpre» c

A represents and explain Ill/Ly an increase in A changes the competitive equilibrium in the way that i

does.

Question 7b: This was a challenging question, particularly because it required you to demonstrate a
deep understanding of competitive equilibrium in an exchange economy. There are many ways to solve

this problem, some less direct than others. Many of you would have been helped by ﬁrst writing down
the definition of a competitive, equilibrium as an allocation in which every individual is maximizing

utility subject. to their budget constraint, with all markets clearing.

Moving Forward

Be sure to carefully review your exam and the suggested solutions (posted on Moodle)

The perfectly competitive (partial and general) equilibrium model is an important benchmark to which
we will continuously refer back, so you want a ﬁrm grasp of the material

The cumulative final exam may require you to:

—» Derive demand curves (or labor supply curves) via utility maximization
-—— Derive cost curves via cost minimization

—~ Derive supply curves via proﬁt maximization

Do not give up if you are disappointed with your score — we still have a lot of material to cover and
the ﬁnal is worth almost the same as the two midterms combined

Seek help in ofﬁce hours, in individual appointments with me, at the CAB, and with classmates — you
need to take responsibility for your success and I Will do Whatever I can to support you

The ﬁnal third of the class is a potpourri of microeconomic theory and it is important that you keep
track of each topic and know how it relates to the other topics and to the competitive benchmark

And don’t forget how much you have already learned in this very difﬁcult course
