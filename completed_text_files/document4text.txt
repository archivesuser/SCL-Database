Pollitt divides his argument in 5 main chronological periods, each one segmented from
the other in political and cultural climate and consequently in the characteristics of the artwork

produced. Pollitt clearly uses the political and cultural norms seen in each sub-era as a catalyst

and a cause for the type of art made during each time period. Throughout the Archaic. Transition

between the individual and the group changes dramatically. In the Archaic age, the individual

begins as dependent on the group, on society as an institution. When the sense of a common

society or group fails the individual towards the Hellenistic period. they turn inward and create a
world centralized around the personal experience. Thus, the artwork created during ancient

Greece is a by-product of the experience of the individual.

because we have very little detail surrounding it. Following the fall of the Pre-Helladic worlds in

1100 BC was a nomadic period where peoples from the east moved into mainland Greece.

Consequently, we see a “dark period” in between 1100 BC and 600 BC where very little artwork

was produced. It is not until the prom—geometric phase around 775 BC where we speculate that

migrants began to settle and create art again. This stabilization allowed for the ﬁrst

homogenization of the people in Greece since the Minoan and Mycenean civilizations. Greeks
