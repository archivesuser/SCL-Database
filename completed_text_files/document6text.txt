utopianism—as though "queer" were a happy umbrella term for the rainbow coalition that would exclude no one

and its American bias. By 1994, de Lauretis was already complaining that the term had "very quickly become a

conceptually vacuous creature of the publishing industry."

A look at the subsequent history of Series Q shows that judgment premature. Far from being conceptually vacuou
queer theory now has the shape of a searching and still largely undigested conversation, rich enough to have man
branches, some different enough to be incommensurate with one another. Still, one knows what de Lauretis mean

A kind of hype had set in, and looking back at the writing from the period now, what strikes me is how many peopl
were on guard about it, even as they found it intellectually generative.

What is often forgotten about that moment is that the term came from grass-roots politics before it became theory.

Act Up had already made possible a politics directed against shame and normalization, and aiming at a complex

mobilization of people beyond sexual identity. It in turn gave rise to other groups, including Queer Nation—whose
name seemed, as I recall, mainly hilarious to all of us who heard it.

The emblematic example of that kind of street politics, for me, was an anonymous, photocopied broadside that was
handed around during the 1992 primary season. (Its author, the artist Zoe Leonard, was a member of Fierce Pussy, a
lesbian feminist group with roots in Act Up.) It began with a simple declaration that looked like a familiar kind of
lesbian politics: "I want a dyke for president." (In queer studies, that would now be called "homonationalism. ") But
very quickly, the prose morphed into a set of wishes that, from clause to clause, gained in evocative power as they

moved away from anything that might be imagined within legitimate politics. I quote the remainder in full, because
it is not widely remembered or reprinted:

I want a person with aids for president and I want a fag for vice president and I want someone with no health
insurance and I want someone who grew up in a place where the earth is so saturated with toxic waste that they
didn't have a choice about getting leukemia. I want a president that had an abortion at sixteen and I want a
candidate who isn't the lesser of two evils and I want a president who lost their last lover to aids, who still sees that
in their eyes every time they lay down to rest, who held their lover in their arms and knew they were dying. I want a
president with no airconditioning, a president who has stood on line at the clinic, at the dmv, at the welfare ofﬁce
and has been unemployed and layed off and sexually harassed and gaybashed and deported. I want someone who

has spent the night in the tombs and had a cross burned on their lawn and survived rape. I want someone who has

 

been in love and been hurt, who respects sex, who has made mistakes and learned from them. I want a Black
