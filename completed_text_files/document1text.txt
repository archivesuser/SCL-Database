Question 1 (20 points) v ' . ‘
For each of the following assertions, please indicate whether they are true or false. l\‘o credit Will be given

without an explanation as to why your claim is correct.

a. {4 points) Assertion: It is possible to determine whether a good is normal or inferior by looking at the
shape of a single indifference curve.

FALSE. An indifference curve only reveals the preferences of a consumer. To show inferiority and normality,
we need to show optimal bundles at two different income levels. This will require at least two indiﬁ‘erence

CUH'GS.

b. (4 points) Assertion: The level of utility (weakly) increases as an individual moves downward along the
demand curve.

TR UE. Movement down the demand curve indicates a decrease in price, which rotates the budget constraint
outwards, allowing the individual to expand her set of affordable market baskets and hence choose a basket
that yields at least as much utility as be ore.

c. (4 points) Both Angelina and Brad consume two goods. Both consumers have the same income (I) and
face the same prices (PX and Py). Angelina has utility function

uA(X, Y) = (X + 1)(Y + 1)
while Brad’s utility function is

uB(X,Y) = [(X + my + 1)]2

Assertion: Since Brad obtains more utility from the two goods, his demand for each good will be greater
than Angelina’s.

FALSE. Brad’s utility is just an increasing transformation of Angelina’s and since utility only matters as
an ordinal measure and not a cardinal one, they will consume the same optimal bundle. You can also verify
that this is the case since they will have the same budget constraint, price ratio, and M RSﬁY = M RSgy.

d. (4 points) The income effect for a good following a price change is negative. Assertion: This good must
be an inferior good (at the current income).

FALSE. This would be true if the price change was a price decrease. But if the price increased for a normal
good, decreasing purchasing power, then the income effect would be negative.

e. (4 points) The price of a watch increases by 10%, and you spend a larger fraction of your income on it.
Assertion: The watch must be a Giffen good for you (at your current income).
