Kouros not an Apollo? Andrew Stewart comments: “if the 'l‘enea Kouros smiles, it may be

because in death he is now makarios, “blessed,” alive in a paradise away from the cares of

The next chapter in Pollitt’s book, Consciousness and Conscience, is centralized around

the Early Classical period. After the breakup of the Mycenean civilization, the Greek world

consisted of small communities called poleis. Pollitt describes the organization of authority in

these poleis on page 10, “in each of the poleis authority, political and moral, ultimately rested in

an enfranchised group of citizens” (Pollitt, 10). Eventually the Athenian poleis established a

constitutional democracy where the demos, or the male population above the age of l 8. carried
all the power. Perhaps the most deﬁning characteristic of this new political organization, was that

the concern of the individual became more synonymous with the concerns of the group ( Pollitt.

10). The individual’s experience was based upon the climate that was collectively created and

maintained in the poleis.
