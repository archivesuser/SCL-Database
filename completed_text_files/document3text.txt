This article will provide the theoretical and conceptual grounding for forthcoming dis-
cussions regarding how critical race theory (CRT), as a discourse of liberation, can be
used as a methodological and epistemological tool to expose the ways race and racism
affect the education and lives of racial minorities in the United States. To that extent, the
goal is threefold. First, the authors seek to adequately deﬁne CRT by situating it within a
specific socio»historical context. Second, they seek to present an argument for why there
is a need for CRT in educational and qualitative research. In doing so, they discuss the
ways concerns regarding race and racism have or have not been addressed previously in
educational research. Finally, they speculate about what lies ahead. In doing so, they
fully assess the possible points of agreement and conﬂicts between CRT and qualitative
research in education.

In this special issue titled ”Critical Race Theory and Qualitative Research,”
we not only reflect on the role and status of qualitative research in the lives of
people of color but also examine the ways critical race theory (CRT)——a legal
theory of race and racism designed to uncover how race and racism operate in
the law and in society—can be used as a tool through which to deﬁne, expose,
and address educational problems. The goalhere is to look specifically athow
such issues can be addressed through the use of the qualitative research para—
digm. Each of the articles contributes toward the goal of completing this
important task in different ways. They do this specifically by arguing for the
nexus of CRT and qualitative research methodologies to address the particu—
lar historical, legal, and contemporary social context of persons of color while
discussing how the work informs criticisms of Whiteness and White privi-
lege. This article will provide the theoretical and conceptual grounding for
forthcoming discussions regarding the specific ways CRT, as a discourse of
liberation, can be used as a methodological tool as well as a greater ontologi-
